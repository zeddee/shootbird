      <description>AI is not magic. Movies have overwrought this idea that we&amp;#8217;re making tiny microprocessor equivalents of the human brain that can talk, think, and act like us. But the reality is quite different.
 Here, I&amp;#8217;ll cover how to question an AI/ML claim, because the hardest part about asking questions about a subject is knowing where to start. Hopefully, this would provide you with better tooling with which to think about AI/ML and move past outdated movie tropes.</description>
