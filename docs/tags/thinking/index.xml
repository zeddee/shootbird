      <description>One of the things I constantly struggle with is managing complexity in writing. Write too complex a piece, and it&amp;#8217;ll sit there unread and unused. But stripping away complexity also strips away meaning, and risks context collapse (which I want to deal with soon).
 Stanford University&amp;#8217;s Prof. Robert Sapolsky seems to manage this balance between complexity and accessibility in his course &#34;BIO150, Introduction to Human Behavioural Biology&#34;, available on YouTube.</description>
