      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m skipping the rest of Westworld S2 because it&amp;rsquo;s turned out to be a fairly straightforward season, and instead am going to focus on what its finale did. S2E10 very neatly ties off the narrative threads that it starts off, even explaining Bernard&amp;rsquo;s fragmented experience of time as a safety mechanism that he&amp;rsquo;s written into his own code to prevent anyone (even himself) from deciphering his memories.
I think S2E10 not only serves as a fitting ending for the season, but also brings up several important points.</description>
