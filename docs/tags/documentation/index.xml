      <description>A technical writer asks questions and writes stuff down. This is more difficult than it sounds — allow me to demonstrate:
 Imagine that you&amp;#8217;ve started work at a café.
 On your first week there, you learn how the coffee machine works: where the beans go, how often it needs to be cleaned. In the middle of that week, you learn which customers are friendly, and who are not. You learn that the coffee machine has a quirk — every tenth pour will give you half the coffee that it usually does.</description>
