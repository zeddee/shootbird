      <description>Excel spreadsheets are an extremely powerful and versatile data format to work with, but comes with the baggage of Microsoft Office formats having been closed proprietary formats for the longest time, and that they&amp;rsquo;re expensive to read i.e. they&amp;rsquo;re binary files that cannot be read by opening them in a text editor.
Fortunately, other tools such as OpenOffice/LibreOffice and the Google Suite have allowed us to work with these Office formats without having to be locked into a particular piece of software.</description>
