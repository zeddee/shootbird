        <div class="section" id="content"><p><a href="https://www.zeddee.com">Zed</a> is a <a href="https:///www.shootbird.work/posts/why-technical-documentation">documentarian</a> who
has worked with software companies to produce end-user and developer
documentation, as well as helped keep their developers sane by
writing stuff down for them. He also writes <a href="https:///www.shootbird.work/blog">here</a>
about design, software, and ethics.</p>

<p>While not formally trained as a software developer, he&rsquo;s been thrown
(by well-meaning colleagues and himself mostly) into enough development-heavy projects that
has made him fluent in dev-speak, and holds his own when writing about
<a href="https:///www.shootbird.work/hire-us">technical subjects</a> in a human-friendly manner.</p>

for business enquiries, or if you want to talk about anything he&rsquo;s written about.</p>

<p><strong>打鳥</strong> (.v, Hokkien; <em>pak jiao</em>), literally translates as &ldquo;shoot bird&rdquo;
and is used to refer to the act of landing a wide shot
i.e. missing the target.
It&rsquo;s also used to describe a person who is literally a bad shot,
or just generally imperceptive.</p>

<p>This metaphor interests me because it&rsquo;s meant to evoke an
image of a person aiming and attempting to shoot (with an imaginary
weapon of choice) a target but their shot landing so wide that it seems like they&rsquo;re trying to shoot birds out of the sky. This, of course, assumes
that the target of value is the set one, and not the bird that is seemingly
a casualty of collateral damage.</p>

<p>But in a world where precision tends to mean &ldquo;algorithmic&rdquo; and &ldquo;machine-like&rdquo;, if not &ldquo;machinic&rdquo;, perhaps it&rsquo;s worth exploring things that are off-centre, off-target, at the edge of vision (in the periphery), and sometimes, out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shooting birds&rdquo; — and what we&rsquo;re trying to do here at <a href="https:///www.shootbird.work/what-is-shootbird">ShootBird</a> — is therefore an exercise in exploring the periphery in hope that sometimes, what can seem like bad aim in the
service of finding a meatier target than if you were on target.</p>
