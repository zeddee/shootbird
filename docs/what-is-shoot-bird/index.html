<p>打鳥 (.v, Hokkien; <em>pak jiao</em>), literally translates as &ldquo;shoot bird&rdquo;
and is used to refer to the act of landing a wide shot
i.e. missing the target.
It&rsquo;s also used to describe a person who is literally a bad shot,
or just generally imperceptive.</p>

<p>This metaphor interests me because it&rsquo;s meant to evoke an
image of a person aiming and attempting to shoot (with an imaginary
weapon of choice) a target but their shot landing so wide that it seems like they&rsquo;re trying to shoot birds out of the sky. This, of course, assumes
that the target of value is the set one, and not the bird that is seemingly
a casualty of collateral damage.</p>

<p>But in a world where precision tends to mean &ldquo;algorithmic&rdquo; and &ldquo;machine-like&rdquo;, if not &ldquo;machinic&rdquo;, perhaps it&rsquo;s worth exploring things that are off-centre, off-target, at the edge of vision (in the periphery), and sometimes, out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shooting birds&rdquo; — and what we&rsquo;re trying to do here at <a href="/what-is-shoot-bird">Shoot Bird</a> — is therefore an exercise in exploring the periphery in hope that sometimes, what can seem like bad aim in the
service of finding a meatier target than if you were on target.</p>
