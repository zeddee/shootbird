<p>One of the things I constantly struggle with is managing complexity in writing. Write too complex a piece, and it&#8217;ll sit there unread and unused. But stripping away complexity also strips away meaning, and risks context collapse (which I want to deal with soon).</p>

<p>Stanford University&#8217;s Prof. Robert Sapolsky seems to manage this balance between complexity and accessibility in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&amp;t=2878s">his course "BIO150, Introduction to Human Behavioural Biology"</a>, available on YouTube. I highly recommend giving the hour-long lecture (and if you have the time, his whole series of lectures) a watch. If anything, you&#8217;ll laugh a bit and learn a lot how humans are a lot like our genetic cousins.</p>

<p>In his introductory YouTube lecture, Sapolsky lists James Gleick&#8217;s <em>Chaos</em> as a prescribed reading in his syllabus. How he describes the book sums up his approach to complex behaviour:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this book does is introduce this radically different of thinking about biology, taking apart a world of reductionism. For 500 years, we all have been using a very simple model for thinking about living systems, which is: if you want to understand something that is complicated, you break it apart into its little pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And once you understand the little pieces, put it back together and you will understand the complex thing. And what Chaos as entire field is about — and this is pretty much the first book made for the lay-public about it — what <em>Chaos</em> shows is: that&#8217;s how you fix clocks. That&#8217;s not how you fix behaviours. That&#8217;s not how you understand behaviours. <strong>Behaviour is not a clock. Behaviour is like a cloud, and we don&#8217;t understand rainfall by breakng a cloud down into its component pieces and gluing them back together</strong>.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t think he means that you shouldn&#8217;t break things down, but more that you shouldn&#8217;t break things down and assume that you haven&#8217;t lost any information in the process. I think it also means that we should have the license to keep things complex — that is, to not immediately cave and dismantle a complex thing so that we&#8217;re only staring at its component parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a side note, there&#8217;s a book that I&#8217;ve been meaning to read for a long time that also deals with complexity in a (relatively) accessible manner: Allen B. Downey&#8217;s <a href="http://greenteapress.com/complexity/"><em>Think Complexity 2</em></a>. The book aims to teach you how to think computationally with code, which strangely may put it at odds with Sapolsky&#8217;s own approach to complexity. Downey and O&#8217;Reilly have very graciously released the book under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC 3.0</a>, which just means you&#8217;re free to download, read, share, and build upon the material (which means you can use it directly to teach a class!).</p>
