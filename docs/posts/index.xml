 Both friends had the option of either copying the content of their site page by page and saving it, or just rewriting all their content from scratch.</description>

      <title>Struggling with complexity</title>

      <description>One of the things I constantly struggle with is managing complexity in writing. Write too complex a piece, and it&amp;#8217;ll sit there unread and unused. But stripping away complexity also strips away meaning, and risks context collapse (which I want to deal with soon).
 Stanford University&amp;#8217;s Prof. Robert Sapolsky seems to manage this balance between complexity and accessibility in his course &#34;BIO150, Introduction to Human Behavioural Biology&#34;, available on YouTube.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Westworld S2E10</title>
      <link>https://www.shootbird.work/posts/westworld-s2e10/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m skipping the rest of Westworld S2 because it&amp;rsquo;s turned out to be a fairly straightforward season, and instead am going to focus on what its finale did. S2E10 very neatly ties off the narrative threads that it starts off, even explaining Bernard&amp;rsquo;s fragmented experience of time as a safety mechanism that he&amp;rsquo;s written into his own code to prevent anyone (even himself) from deciphering his memories.
I think S2E10 not only serves as a fitting ending for the season, but also brings up several important points.</description>

Scary Computer Stuff (or How I Learnt to Stop Worrying and Love the Terminal).  Overview The terminal (and it&amp;#8217;s Windows counterparts, the Command Prompt and PowerShell) are terrifying to behold if you have no idea what you&amp;#8217;re doing. In When to Start Naming Things, we&amp;#8217;ve talked about text labels and design conventions in graphic interfaces.</description>

      <title>When to Start Naming Things</title>

      <description>First rule of magic: Don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone know your real name. Names have power.1
 Microcopy isn&amp;rsquo;t usually at the top of the list when it comes to developing interfaces — button text is usually straightforward when it comes to the nondescript &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;Cancel&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Confirm&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo;. In fact, given the high rate of smartphone penetration, the value of screen real-estate favours use of iconography over text to communicate functionality.</description>

      <title>Why Technical Documentation?</title>
      <link>https://www.shootbird.work/posts/why-technical-documentation/</link>

      <description>A technical writer asks questions and writes stuff down. This is more difficult than it sounds — allow me to demonstrate:
 Imagine that you&amp;#8217;ve started work at a café.
 On your first week there, you learn how the coffee machine works: where the beans go, how often it needs to be cleaned. In the middle of that week, you learn which customers are friendly, and who are not. You learn that the coffee machine has a quirk — every tenth pour will give you half the coffee that it usually does.</description>
