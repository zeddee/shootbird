打鳥 (Hokkien, _pak jiao_), literally translates as "shoot bird" (.v),
and is used to refer to the act of landing a wide shot
i.e. missing the target.
It's also used to describe a person who is literally a bad shot,
or just generally imperceptive.

This metaphor interests me, because it's meant to evoke an
image of a person aiming and attempting to shoot (with an imaginary
weapon of choice) a target but their shot landing so wide that it seems like they're trying to shoot birds out of the sky. This, of course, assumes
that the target of value is the set one, and not the bird that is seemingly
a casualty of collateral damage.

But in a world where precision tends to mean "algorithmic" and "machine-like", if not "machinic", perhaps it's worth exploring things that are off-centre, off-target, at the edge of vision (in the periphery), and sometimes, out of sight.

"Shooting birds" — and what we're trying to do here at [Shoot Bird](/what-is-shoot-bird) — therefore is an exercise in exploring the periphery in hope that sometimes, what can seem like bad aim in the
service of finding a meatier target than if you were on target.
