about design, software, and ethics. He is also a documentarian who
has worked with software companies to produce end-user and developer
documentation, as well as helped keep their developers sane by 
writing stuff down for them.
Ping him at [zed@nsdmdh.com](mailto://zed@nsdmdh.com)
for business enquiries, or if you want to talk about anything he's written about.
